\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Factory method is a creational design pattern, i.\+e., related to object creation. In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to client and the client use the same common interface to create new type of object. The idea is to use a static member-\/function (static factory method) which creates \& returns instances, hiding the details of class modules from user. A factory pattern is one of the core design principles to create an object, allowing clients to create objects of a library(explained below) in a way such that it doesnâ€™t have tight coupling with the class hierarchy of the library. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following files\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
